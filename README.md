## 🚀 About This Repo

This is where I store my solutions to challenges from [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/).  
It’s not organized by difficulty — just by **kata name** — since I’m focusing more on learning than categorizing.

Use it as:

- A way to track progress ✅  
- A quick reference for Python tricks 🐍  
- A collection of “oh yeah, I figured that out once” moments 🤔
